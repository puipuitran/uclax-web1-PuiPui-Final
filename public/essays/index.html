        <h1>Final Project Homework</h1>
        <h2>01. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>HTML</b>: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It creates the structure of a website.
                HTML requires developers to use a predefined list of tags. 
                HTML is static - meaning items are not animated.</li>

                <li><b>CSS</b>: CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. It allows developers to determine the size, color, and locations of the items on the website.
                HTML is static - meaning items are not animated. Visuals - the human skin.</b>

                <li><b>JavaScript</b>: Javascipt gives you the ability to change the HTML and CSS on the page. It allows developers to create interactions on the website.</li> 
        
        <h2>02. What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Single Page Apps (SPAs)</b>: Single Page Apps work in the browser and requires no page reload (simlar to Twitter and Trello). The page doens't need to be upadted since content is downloaded automatically. They are fast and responsive since they don't udpate the entire page but only required content. Most resources (HTML/CSS/Scripts) are only loaded once throughout the lifespan of an application. Only data is transmitted back and forth.</li>
                     
                <li><b>Multi-Page Apps (PPAs)</b>: Multi-Page Apps consist of several pages with static information (text, images, etc.) and a lot of links to other pages. Multi-page apps work in a traditional way and are extremely large out of necessity. PPAs are better for SEO, but they're typically slower and require more maintenance.</li>
