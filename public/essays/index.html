        <h1>Final Project Homework</h1>
        <h2>01. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>HTML</b>: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It creates the structure of a website.
                HTML requires developers to use a predefined list of tags. 
                HTML is static - meaning items are not animated.</li>

                <li><b>CSS</b>: CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. It allows developers to determine the size, color, and locations of the items on the website.
                HTML is static - meaning items are not animated. Visuals - the human skin.</b>

                <li><b>JavaScript</b>: Javascipt gives you the ability to change the HTML and CSS on the page. It allows developers to create interactions on the website.</li> 
            </ol>

        <h2>02. What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Single Page Apps (SPAs)</b>: Single Page Apps work in the browser and requires no page reload (simlar to Twitter and Trello). The page doesn't need to be upadted since content is downloaded automatically. They are fast and responsive since they don't udpate the entire page but only required content. Most resources (HTML/CSS/Scripts) are only loaded once throughout the lifespan of an application. Only data is transmitted back and forth. Puts the burden/control on JavaScript.</li>
                     
                <li><b>Multi-Page Apps (PPAs)</b>: Multi-Page Apps consist of several pages with static information (text, images, etc.) and a lot of links to other pages. Multi-page apps work in a traditional way and are extremely large out of necessity. PPAs are better for SEO, but they're typically slower and require more maintenance.</li>   
            </ol>    

        <h2>03. What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Web Designer</b>: A web designr is responsible for the "look" of the website by using deisgn softwares such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator. They don't necessarily have to be in charge of the front end developer of your website.</li>
                
                <li><b>Front End Developer</b>: A front end developer is responsible for making the design come to live by using HTML, CSS, JQery and JavaScript. They are concerned with making sure the website works with different browsers, and is in line with the business's goals, whether it be optimizing SEO or increase sales (user experience).</li>

                <li><b>Back End Developer</b>: A back end developer is responsible for building and maintaining the back end of the website, inclusing the server, application code, and database. They focus on databases, scripting, and the architecture of websites. Codes written by back-end developers help to communicate the database information to the browser.</li>
            </ol>   

            <h2>04. Distinguish the differences between Site Relative, Document Relative, and Absolute Paths.</h2>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Site Relative</b>: In a site-relative link the address always begins with a forward slash -- "/". The forward slash indicates that the address is relative to the web server's notion of the site root.</li>
                      
                    <li><b>Document Relative</b>: Any relative link that is NOT a site-relative link MUST be a document-relative link. Document-relative links are links that are relative to the document that contains them.</li>    

                    <li><b>Absolute Paths</b>: Alternatively referred to as file path and full path, the absolute path contains the root directory and all other subdirectories where a file or folder is contained. It is the location of a file or directory in a computer which contain the root directory and the complete directory list that is required to locate the file or directory.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>*Final Project Description*</h2>
            <p>For my final project, I would like to build an online portfolio for all of my design, photo, and video works. As of now, my content is spreaded across YouTube, Format (a photo portfolio website), and Wordpress. I would like to create a hub for my audience and recruiters to see all of my work, with some simple animations. I want to create an engaging and visually appealing website that reflects my personality. I would love to incorporate an online shop into the site later on as well. </p>

            <h2>05. What it means for a company to be Agile? What is the purpose of using Agile, and its Pros and Cons?</h2>
            <p>An agile company is a business that has the ability to quickly adapt to market changes. There are some of the key identifying characteristics of an agile company. The must be fast-moving and flexible, have rapid response to unexpected obstacles, lead change, be in touch with customers, and have continuous competitive advantage, and flat organizational structure for quick communication (aka Fast Fail method)</p>
            <b>Pros:</b> 
            <li>Forces a team to collaborate due to the time constraint.</li>
            <li>It lets clients get involved with the innovation process.</li>
            <li>It forges a closer, more comprehensive relationship with each client.</li>
            <li>Deployment happends more quickly.</li>
            <li>Much easier to manage costs.</li>
            <b>Cons:</b>
            <li>Costs are less predictable.</li>
            <li>It can only be truly implemented when clients make themselves available.</li>
            <li>Agile method can be difficult to understand (jargons)</li>
            <li>It only works well for large software design projects.</li>
            <li>Timing can be problematic: Because agile methodology is about quality over speed, it can be difficult to predict when a project will be completed.</li>
            </p>

            <h2>06. Define the following roles: Project Manager, Business Analyst, Scrum Master, UX designer, Web Developer/Engineer, Quality Assurance Tester, and DevOps.</h2>
            <p>
                <li><b>Project Manager</b>: A Project Manager (PM) is responsible for overseeing the successful completion of projects and can work in a wide variety of fields, such as information technology, construction and advertising. Although specific tasks will depend on a Project Manager’s employer and their current project, they will generally be responsible for the creation, organization, execution and completion of specific projects. This includes managing relevant employees, setting deadlines, communicating with company executives about the state of the project, ensuring projects stay on track and on budget, and adjusting if necessary to meet new requirements. Project Managers typically manage six different aspects of projects: scope, schedule, finance, risk, quality and resources.</li>
                <li><b>Business Analyst</b>: A Business Analyst acts as the key interface between the users and the project manager they gather information, document processes, and confirm the final documents with users. Through the power of data analytics, they provide insights to stakeholders and company decision-makers, allowing them to select paths for improving procedures, services, products, and, of course, the bottom line.</li>
                <li><b>Scrum Master</b>: Scrum is a framework that lets people work together so that teams can create, deliver, and maintain a complex product. Scrum teams manage their work by deciding on sets of fixed time periods called sprints and then achieving preset product development goals within those sprints. The scrum master acts as a mediator between the development team and the product owner, coaching team members and facilitating the project as needed.</li>
                <li><b>UX Designer</b>: UX design focuses on the interaction between real human users (like you and me) and everyday products and services, such as websites, apps, and even coffee machines. It’s an extremely varied discipline, combining aspects of psychology, business, market research, design, and technology. As a UX designer, it’s your job first and foremost to advocate for the end user or customer. Whether you’re designing a brand new product, coming up with a new feature, or making changes to an existing product or service—the UX designer must consider what’s best for the user and the overall user experience. At the same time, you are also responsible for making sure that the product or service meets the needs of the business.</li>
                <li><b> Web Developer/Engineer</b>: A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design - which has been created by either a client or a design team - and turns it into a website. They do this by writing lines and lines of complicated code, using a variety of languages. Web developers have quite a difficult job, because they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English, and translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.</li>
                <li><b>Quality Assurance Tester</b>: Also known as quality assurance technicians or software quality assurance engineers, QA testers are primarily responsible for checking new software products, such as those for gaming systems or mobile applications, for defects or issues. QA testers run various tests on software to ensure it meets all standards and guidelines and is ready to be marketed to consumers. They identify issues and run debugging programs as needed. QA testers also generate reports, work with software developers to correct issues, and upgrade databases as required.</li>
                <li><b>DevOps</b>: DevOps is a collaboration between Development and IT Operations to make software production and deployment in an automated & repeatable way. DevOps helps to increase the organization's speed to deliver software applications and services. The word 'DevOps' is a combination of two words, 'Development' and 'Operations.' It allows organizations to serve their customers better and compete more strongly in the market. In simple words, DevOps can be defined as an alignment of development and IT operations with better communication and collaboration.</li>
                </p>

            <h2>07. What is the difference between jpg, gif, png and SVG images?</h2>
            <p>
            <li><b>JPG:</b>A JPG file is an image saved in a compressed image format standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). It is commonly used for storing digital photos and used by most digital cameras to save images.</li>
            <li><b>GIF:</b>A GIF (Graphical Interchange Format) is an image format invented in 1987 by Steve Wilhite, a US software writer who was looking for a way to animate images in the smallest file size. In short, GIFs are a series of images or soundless video that will loop continuously and doesn’t require anyone to press play.</li>
            <li><b>SVG:</b>A file with the SVG file extension is most likely a Scalable Vector Graphics file. Files in this format use an XML-based text format to describe how the image should appear. Since text is used to describe the graphic, an SVG file can be scaled to different sizes without losing quality—in other words, the format is resolution-independent. This is why website and print graphics are often built in the SVG format, so they can be resized to fit different designs in the future.</li>
            <li><b>PNG:</b>A PNG file is a Portable Network Graphics file. The format uses lossless compression and is generally considered the replacement to the GIF image format. However, unlike GIF, PNG files do not support animations. The very similar MNG (Multiple-image Network Graphics) format does, however, but has yet to gain the kind of popularity that GIF or PNG files have.</li>
            </p>

            <h2>08. What are testing environments? What is the difference between Local, Dev, QA and Production?</h2>
            <p>A testing environment is a setup of software and hardware for the testing teams to execute test cases. In other words, it supports test execution with hardware, software and network configured.</p>
            <li><b>Local:</b> A local server is hosted locally on your own computer while a remote server is hosted elsewhere. It might be a paid hosting plan, another computer on a local area network, or even a free hosting plan.</li>
            <li><b>Dev:</b> Development testing (DevTest) is an approach in software development that aims to bring the development and testing phases closer together. In traditional software development, development and testing are two separate siloed functions. The challenge with this approach is that it introduces delay between code being written and that same code being tested. In DevTest, these phases are more tightly integrated so that code that is being written and checked in is automatically tested. In this way, problems can be more quickly discovered and addressed.</li>
            <li><b>QA:</b> Quality assurance testing is quality assurance(QA) or a quality testing process that ensures that an organization delivers the best products or services possible. QA aims to deliver consistent results through a set of standardized procedures, which means that organizations also need to make sure that their processes for achieving the desired results hit specific quality benchmarks themselves.</li>
            <li><b>Production:</b> Testing is production basically lets a DevOps team prepare for possible bugs. It is common for bugs to end up in production. If the team is prepared to handle such bugs, then they can be resolved much quicker via continuous monitoring. This is what testing in production aims to accomplish. Production testing can also be important for analyzing user experience. A/B testing is an important tool employed at this stage, which helps monitor how a new or recently updated feature is being received by the target users.</li>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Function vs Form: When are web images considered part of the content (HTML) as opposed to part of the appearance (CSS)?</h2>
            <p>HTML images use the IMG tag and references the Source (external link). CSS images uses background-image and is only for decorative pursposes. When images are added using HTML, they are indexed by search engines and can be printed, whereas CSS images can be switched out easily, while decreasing download time.</p>

            <h2>What is considered the right size for an image or video asset?</h2>
            <li><b>Full width images:</b> 2400x1600px, jpeg, saved for web, and optimized.</li>
            <li><b>Inside Content Images:</b> Horizontal – max width 1500px, jpeg, saved for web, and optimized. Vertical – max width 1000px, jpeg, saved for web, and optimized.</li>
            
            <h2>What is the difference between IDs, Classes and Tags? How does Specificity play a role in the selection of HTML elements (both in CSS and JS)</h2>
            <li><b>ID:</b> The id attribute is used to label sections or parts of your HTML document. You may only use the same id once per page, so save it for important major sections of your page. Additionally, the id selector in CSS has a high specificity level and therefore overrules other things (like the class selector).</li>
            <li><b>Class:</b>If a page had multiple sidebar chunks, we might want to make one class so that we could use CSS to style each chunk with one rule.</li>
            <li><b>Tag:</b> Div Tag - The div tag is a block level HTML element. It is used to divide or section of other HTML tags in to meaningful groups.</li>
