        <h1>Final Project Homework</h1>
        <h2>01. Explain the difference between HTML, CSS and JS.</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>HTML</b>: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It creates the structure of a website.
                HTML requires developers to use a predefined list of tags. 
                HTML is static - meaning items are not animated.</li>

                <li><b>CSS</b>: CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. It allows developers to determine the size, color, and locations of the items on the website.
                HTML is static - meaning items are not animated. Visuals - the human skin.</b>

                <li><b>JavaScript</b>: Javascipt gives you the ability to change the HTML and CSS on the page. It allows developers to create interactions on the website.</li> 
            </ol>

        <h2>02. What are Single Page Apps (SPAs)? How do they differ from traditional multi-page Web Sites?</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Single Page Apps (SPAs)</b>: Single Page Apps work in the browser and requires no page reload (simlar to Twitter and Trello). The page doesn't need to be upadted since content is downloaded automatically. They are fast and responsive since they don't udpate the entire page but only required content. Most resources (HTML/CSS/Scripts) are only loaded once throughout the lifespan of an application. Only data is transmitted back and forth. Puts the burden/control on JavaScript.</li>
                     
                <li><b>Multi-Page Apps (PPAs)</b>: Multi-Page Apps consist of several pages with static information (text, images, etc.) and a lot of links to other pages. Multi-page apps work in a traditional way and are extremely large out of necessity. PPAs are better for SEO, but they're typically slower and require more maintenance.</li>   
            </ol>    

        <h2>03. What is the difference between Web Designer, Front End Developer and Back End Developer?</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Web Designer</b>: A web designr is responsible for the "look" of the website by using deisgn softwares such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator. They don't necessarily have to be in charge of the front end developer of your website.</li>
                
                <l1><b>Front End Developer</b>: A front end developer is responsible for making the design come to live by using HTML, CSS, JQery and JavaScript. They are concerned with making sure the website works with different browsers, and is in line with the business's goals, whether it be optimizing SEO or increase sales (user experience).</l1>

                <li><b>Back End Developer</b>: A back end developer is responsible for building and maintaining the back end of the website, inclusing the server, application code, and database. They focus on databases, scripting, and the architecture of websites. Codes written by back-end developers help to communicate the database information to the browser.</li>
